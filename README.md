Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial, sought to enhance the security posture of their software applications. They required a thorough assessment and mitigation of potential vulnerabilities to safeguard their financial data and client information.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I excelled in identifying and addressing software security vulnerabilities, recognizing the paramount importance of secure coding. Secure coding practices not only protect against data breaches but also help the company's reputation and compliance with regulatory standards, contributing significantly to its overall wellbeing.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The vulnerability assessment process was both challenging and valuable insights, particularly in navigating complex security requirements and integrating layers of security. This process was important in understanding the nature of software vulnerabilities.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I increased security through stringent input validation, encrypted data storage and transmission, and secure API interactions. Moving forward, I would plan to leverage automated vulnerability scanning tools and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for ongoing security assessments.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
Post-refactoring, I employed rigorous testing, including functional and security testing, to ensure the application's integrity.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Key resources included industry-standard encryption libraries, secure coding guidelines, and vulnerability scanning tools. These tools and practices are not only important for current tasks but also invaluable for future projects.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
This project serves as a showcase of my ability to enhance software security, including detailed vulnerability assessments, effective mitigation strategies, and a commitment to secure coding practices. It demonstrates a holistic approach to security, from assessment to implementation and verification.
